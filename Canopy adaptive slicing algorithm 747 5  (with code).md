#  I. Introduction 

>  I saw such a method for slicing in the paper before. The specific process is as follows: 1. First, perform isometric stratification according to the specified number of layers. 2. Calculate the projected area of each layer of point cloud. 3. Calculate the area ratio between adjacent layers and calculate the average value of all ratios. 4. Classify point cloud slices larger than the average ratio into one category, and vice versa into another category. 5. Compare whether adjacent point cloud slices are of the same type, and merge if they are of the same type, otherwise they will not be merged.
