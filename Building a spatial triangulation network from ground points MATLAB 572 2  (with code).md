#  I. Introduction 

>  Here we use a window to select the lowest point in the window as the ground point. Drawing on the idea of greedy projection triangulation in PCL, we first obtain the ground point and project it to the horizontal plane, and then use the triangulation function in MATLAB to construct a spatial triangulation network.
