#  Overview of the principle 

>  (1) Using the method in the initial segmentation center selection model based on voxel, we first select the initial clustering center (improvement). (2) Using the method of kmeans clustering to cluster point cloud data, the specific principle of kmeans clustering has been introduced in detail in the previous article (point cloud K-Means clustering algorithm), here is the code directly.
